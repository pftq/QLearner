The Examples folder contains ready-to-use plugins for the QLearner program (https://www.pftq.com/qlearner/).  Open QLearner and browse to one of the .dll files directly inside the Examples folder to use them.  The folders within the Examples folder are the projects/source code used to create the plugins.  I also include the code for the QLearning algorithms already in the core program itself for those curious how they're implemented as well as how I improved upon them in my variations.

The PluginTemplate folder contains a template project to guide you through making your own custom plugins and QStates.

The Documentation folder contains the class interfaces you implement to create your plugins, as well as a reference of all the functions available to your use.
